## Description

An R Markdown exploratory data analysis (eda) comparing Zillow property prices with AirBnB rentals. The eda utilizes an R package for much of the data cleaning and preparation to fulfill the requirements for the final project of [cs50's Introduction to Programming with R](https://cs50.harvard.edu/r/2024/). This is my first ever eda in R, so it's more about practice than viable, useful insights.
